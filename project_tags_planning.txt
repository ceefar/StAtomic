ok obvs just start simple FFS

but thinking what would be good is like the parent of each tag 
e.g. programming, (maybe not then conditions but maybe idk - lets just say like a specific so - maybe theres a further level to group stuff but whatever...)
like the parent actually lets say core of the tag
has its own modifiers to tasks too

for example,

an adhd task can have an extra notification thing that will just notify you alot (like setting loads of morning alarms)
and similar idea for other things
maybe not exactly like this but some kinda similar idea could be cool right
like the core tag influences the todo/habit in some way not just by notifiying but maybe its like you review it weekly or something
and each weekly review for a core is slightly different < BEST MVP CONCEPT!
