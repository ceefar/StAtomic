OK SO 

note - obvs snowflake, once is at a decent level port to snowflake with full refactor?

huge note - when redoing obvs since users will have to have user as a field too since reference tables
- mean sure in theory could create 4 tables for each user but really isnt viable for any kind of scaling lol

Keep everything you have tbf but will be no extra functionality for that stuff (like urgency for example)
it will just be printed out nicely in the view page and with img and for discord

get crud working
then move to that api discord tut thing as want to have like study lion bot too

so imagine then you can view on web app or on discord the same stuff (will require user authentication)

get the images to look beaut tho, like study lion with even more info,
so like you can print out ur todo for each task and its like yanno writing loads of todo lists for urself
but then just being able to recall them at any time in a nice handy image 

and then some basic stats about ur progress after this and then more work on subtask concept and maybe tags but subtask first


***** CRITICAL SCHEMA UPDATES *****
- obvs user in every table, like obvs obvious ones but also like todo id name would be crucial
