sort basic format for print out stuff 
then
do img thing to draft with simple download/save button (mostly to see working)
    note! - decide what specifically you want to do but just draft sumnt simple quickly as will come back to later
    and note that since i dont wanna be printing single imgs for every single task right
    what actually want is...
    - child+parent imgs again
    - ig an img of just titles of all tasks sure (still showing child parent relationships tho)
    - then ig more detailed view of main only tasks (since not everything has child duh)
then
child parent logic proper print (should be easy its just ordering the list of dictionaries and indenting child tasks)
- logic sorted, need to implement html/css for indenting subtasks, and also print/save todo img but note just do for main tasks only bosh!



******************************************************************
PLEEEEEEASE REWRITE THESE NOTES! (lmao) - and conglomorate others?
******************************************************************


and then show the img in a col to the right, with option to download/save the img

actually then quickly go back to subtask view as would be nice to have an option for just show 1 instead of all! 
- tbh would be a better default too, obvs still having an all option tho

note
- print out the query, possibly as img, idea
- st.echo achieves this btw - implement some kinda dropdown or sumnt on top tho 

note
- almost think should have like subtitle which is what basically current 'details' is now
- then an actual details which you can make as long as you want
- which would be used for imgs (print only info for that task) and for the more detailed stored info bit
    - and therefore is more relevant, IF long_ass_text THEN save it to storage

note
- doesnt seem like todolistid (i.e. 1 or 2) is working as expected for tags, confirm wassup

note
- doesnt add all tags in filter view, just selected tags in tag filter, hardly a major mvp issue but still...

note
- big note for future/final refactor, hadnt even considered this but how tags interact on a child parent level, 
- children should inherit all their parents tags (think view screens, if they didnt would be messed up)
- but children should have the ability to have their own unique ones too!
- for sure has view considerations but tbh firstly should be edge cases, and secondly its a small personal project for portfolio
- if u wanna actually make this (which I kinda do) you need to do it in flutter anyway imo

note [SO MUCH THIS]
- actually really want some kind of way to save notes based on a task or todo (plus img maybe even? or ability for it to write you one!)
- so that you can save things like meal list for example or go back and check an old (good) shopping list
- even the abililty to upload ur own images would be great (and would teach me how to store imgs as binary data!)

note
- adding actual proper task info will make it look a LOT cleaner, do some quickly for one of the lists!

note
- for sure want a super simple view version too ffs, maybe thats just 2 dropdowns and an img or text or sumnt idk

then 
- maaaybe test delete
- maaaaybe test some kinda insights (you finish lots of tasks on the weekend, the avg time to complete, metric showing how many live tasks left, urgent tasks etc!!)
- then defo discord api tut ting
- then group project? well either way defo have some person things to get done




note for setting the parent to do must consider if has children, if does have children should you be able to set it to done?
- i would say no but this is poor ux, how about a prompt like 'if you set this to done you set all the kids too' (obvs not that wording but ya get me) 
- also big duhhh but also logic for (and could just be the standard way - atleast for now anyways) if all kids completed then parent is completed too? (is has children)
    - hmmmm dont want it to delete or anything tho since you may want to add more, does need considerations, again maybe a prompt on all kids completed...

also global preset theme - if possible slight tweeks by page would be desirable but if not is chill


note 
- im suuuure checkbox instead of slider will work (tho obvs means only 2 vars so is more meh tbf tho it would look much cleaner)
- would just need to have it set based on the true false vars instead, but meh since would actually quite like pause (and maybe else in future)
- guna leave as slider for now?
