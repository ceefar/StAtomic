if details have a little (the task details) above it possibly with diff color bg?


FUCKING DC MORON!!

- notes save section (if details is long does automatically, else you can find a task and add 
    - ig also could have a specific tag that does this called savenote or whatever 
    - but also a specific tag that autosaves it like shopping list as mentioned below duh lol)
        - you can choose tags that will also do this for you (in future)
- 100 what the first usecase should be IS a shopping list so create it with that in mind and add the tag 
    - it persists stuff and can give you a handy img, you can even create a separate thing here for it to save
    - ig in future you would allow these to be linked via tag or sumnt for easy access say like shopping list

- as per above a little personal journal too for you to get stuff out, writing helps (adhd)

- bearable style tracking for adhd  
- works like this
    - important tasks (tagged adhd) which are then queued up in your 'day' page at the top
    - toggle tasks just under that are just basic things you might forget, which you can set reminders for at certain times/intervals
        - note that since distractability is a real thing you can have these through a set times like lunch for example instead of just (in 4 hours)
    - then just say the very first simple track to be this, so you log these things and see how it impacts just one area, sleep
        - did you walk, if so how long
        - diet marker (good, avg, bad or whatever)
        - social?
        - water?
        - exercise (even tho not doing for sure) (different types too as cardio diff to kickboxing diff to strength training)
        - caffeine intake amount and last time
        - medication time?
        - any exterior stresses (like a gauge?)
        - mood rating (could be linked to/same/similar to above one)

- some kinda super giga basic insights page



******************************************************************
PLEEEEEEASE REWRITE THESE NOTES! (lmao) - and conglomorate others! (4 pages into one please!)
******************************************************************
THEN THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME TO...
- move to v0.4 snowflake (or any db integration) + heavily simplified version for maybe just imgs at first
- obvs users (and password?), and dashboard, proper crud, and basic insights (lmao real simple huh ceef)
- want to implement stuff like that bearable app too (needs planning) 






actually then quickly go back to subtask view as would be nice to have an option for just show 1 instead of all! 
- tbh would be a better default too, obvs still having an all option tho

big note
- they (employers) will likely try to break it from create so try and cover urself a bit
- ESPECIALLY SQL INJECTION

note
- print out the query, possibly as img, idea
- st.echo achieves this btw - implement some kinda dropdown or sumnt on top tho 

note
- almost think should have like subtitle which is what basically current 'details' is now
- then an actual details which you can make as long as you want
- which would be used for imgs (print only info for that task) and for the more detailed stored info bit
    - and therefore is more relevant, IF long_ass_text THEN save it to storage

note
- do want reorder option, for ui use multi select and have it print out?
- or maybe even mutable charts like add_rows https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/mutate

note
- doesnt seem like todolistid (i.e. 1 or 2) is working as expected for tags, confirm wassup

note
- doesnt add all tags in filter view, just selected tags in tag filter, hardly a major mvp issue but still...

note
- big note for future/final refactor, hadnt even considered this but how tags interact on a child parent level, 
- children should inherit all their parents tags (think view screens, if they didnt would be messed up)
- but children should have the ability to have their own unique ones too!
- for sure has view considerations but tbh firstly should be edge cases, and secondly its a small personal project for portfolio
- if u wanna actually make this (which I kinda do) you need to do it in flutter anyway imo

note [SO MUCH THIS]
- actually really want some kind of way to save notes based on a task or todo (plus img maybe even? or ability for it to write you one!)
- so that you can save things like meal list for example or go back and check an old (good) shopping list
- even the abililty to upload ur own images would be great (and would teach me how to store imgs as binary data!)

note
- adding actual proper task info will make it look a LOT cleaner, do some quickly for one of the lists!

note
- for sure want a super simple view version too ffs, maybe thats just 2 dropdowns and an img or text or sumnt idk

then 
- maaaybe test delete
- maaaaybe test some kinda insights (you finish lots of tasks on the weekend, the avg time to complete, metric showing how many live tasks left, urgent tasks etc!!)
- then defo discord api tut ting
- then group project? well either way defo have some person things to get done




note for setting the parent to do must consider if has children, if does have children should you be able to set it to done?
- i would say no but this is poor ux, how about a prompt like 'if you set this to done you set all the kids too' (obvs not that wording but ya get me) 
- also big duhhh but also logic for (and could just be the standard way - atleast for now anyways) if all kids completed then parent is completed too? (is has children)
    - hmmmm dont want it to delete or anything tho since you may want to add more, does need considerations, again maybe a prompt on all kids completed...

also global preset theme - if possible slight tweeks by page would be desirable but if not is chill


note 
- im suuuure checkbox instead of slider will work (tho obvs means only 2 vars so is more meh tbf tho it would look much cleaner)
- would just need to have it set based on the true false vars instead, but meh since would actually quite like pause (and maybe else in future)
- guna leave as slider for now?
