aite so

just do main task actually since thats kinda how they get layered right
obvs can just then make this a sep page and make more dw just do this for now
and then if want changes just make a new page (and call this parent view or whatever)

so what you wanna do is just get a list of main task ids only

then do the main task
then the sub tasks
for that id only

then loop the rest of the main task ids list

underneath each will have generate img
save img

note also need set to done n shit but just do this stuff first tbf
