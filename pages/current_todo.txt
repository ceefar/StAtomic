aite so now,
new page (rename the other one)
duhhh
so
defo want like very top options for you to decide how you view tasks
- obvs that is *always* with todo list being the first thing, never allowing crossover (as should think about them as route to complete a final task right)
- then its
- parent + child dd, parent only, most recent only?, tasks that havent been touched in a long time, (obvs would also be urgency etc which can implement shortly)
- tags duhhhhhh
- either through toggle or just generally like one dd short and one dd long, whatever
- obvs all as just a much more basic view of the task and sub tasks

and then show the img in a col to the right, with option to download/save the img

actually then quickly go back to subtask view as would be nice to have an option for just show 1 instead of all! 
- tbh would be a better default too, obvs still having an all option tho

note
- adding actual proper task info will make it look a LOT cleaner, do some quickly for one of the lists!


then 
(pls shave, much annoy)
- maaaybe test delete
- maaaaybe test some kinda insights (you finish lots of tasks on the weekend, the avg time to complete, metric showing how many live tasks left, urgent tasks etc!!)
- then defo discord api tut ting
- then group project? well either way defo have some person things to get done




note for setting the parent to do must consider if has children, if does have children should you be able to set it to done?
- i would say no but this is poor ux, how about a prompt like 'if you set this to done you set all the kids too' (obvs not that wording but ya get me) 
- also big duhhh but also logic for (and could just be the standard way - atleast for now anyways) if all kids completed then parent is completed too? (is has children)
    - hmmmm dont want it to delete or anything tho since you may want to add more, does need considerations, again maybe a prompt on all kids completed...

also global preset theme - if possible slight tweeks by page would be desirable but if not is chill


note 
- im suuuure checkbox instead of slider will work (tho obvs means only 2 vars so is more meh tbf tho it would look much cleaner)
- would just need to have it set based on the true false vars instead, but meh since would actually quite like pause (and maybe else in future)
- guna leave as slider for now?
