# DOING QUIT IMG TEXT TUTORIAL IN PYTHON FOR THESE PARENT SUBTASK THINGS LIKE THAT DC TODO ADD THEN CONT TO PRINT/VIEW/READ
# MAYBE ACTUALLY JUST IN PRINT PAGE THO DUH AND FFS FORGET ANY FORMATTING RN!
#
# THEN START DOING MORE OF THE THINGS TO BE ADDED TO THE DB
# BIG N0TE THO AS AT THIS POINT SHOULD BE HANDLING VIA FUNCTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
#
# PARENT CHILD DB USING GET LAST ID?
# - this means could add order and then could reorder tbf?!

# better confirmation
# better bottom indicators about selections
# possible way to wipe everything proper
# way to wipe things outside form on submit
# improved skip to top stuff and rest added, possibly with cols?
