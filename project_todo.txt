- get view working with create on a db level
    - maybe at this point try test the custom styling code 
- then 0.2 update for new things in project notes




# better confirmation
# better bottom indicators about selections
# possible way to wipe everything proper
# way to wipe things outside form on submit
# improved skip to top stuff and rest added, possibly with cols?
#
# IF SUB TASK SHOULD BE SETTING IT DUH
# SHOULD BE SETTING STATUS TOO DUH
#
# GET THE TOGGLE ACTUALLY MAKING ADD AS A PARENT THEN GET THE DISPLAY FOR THAT HERE (basic)
# MAYBE ACTUALLY JUST IN PRINT PAGE THO DUH AND FFS FORGET ANY FORMATTING RN!
#
# THEN START DOING MORE OF THE THINGS TO BE ADDED TO THE DB
# BIG N0TE THO AS AT THIS POINT SHOULD BE HANDLING VIA FUNCTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
#
# PARENT CHILD DB USING GET LAST ID?
# - this means could add order and then could reorder tbf?!



CONSIDER CLASS BASED STRUCTURE
- create task, update task... etc!
- atleast do a quick test after implementing the basics?!
