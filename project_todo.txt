- get view working with create on a db level
    - maybe at this point try test the custom styling code 
- then 0.2 update for new things in project notes



- still need to get working create and ig new working view tbf but...
- first, removing alignment here for todo as makes little sense
- moving task type up into check box and a selectbox of parent (probably unworking or rudimentary working)
    - and removing toggle task for now tho do want back?!



CONSIDER CLASS BASED STRUCTURE
- create task, update task... etc!
- atleast do a quick test after implementing the basics?!
